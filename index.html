   <p> <strong>Ques1 :-</strong> Explain the structure of heart and a well-labbeled diagram of heart.</p>
   <p><strong>Ans :- </strong>  Heart is a muscular organ divided into four chambers: two atria (right and left) and two ventricles (right and left). These chambers are separated by valves (tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic) that ensure one-way blood flow. The heart wall has three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. Major blood vessels like the aorta, vena cava, and pulmonary arteries and veins connect the heart to the rest of the body.
